# QBUS X OSM | Garages | Native Garage Script | Reworked

### Nothing much, just removed the Dependency where Owned Cars were only available in ONE GARAGE at a time. Now you cars can be Retrieved from any Garage once stored in any garage accross the Map. 

### Also Check out my other works on this Github or on My Discord.

#### All credit goes to the Creator of this script and not me. This feature was requested by someone, and hence, I thought why not to share it with other people too.
